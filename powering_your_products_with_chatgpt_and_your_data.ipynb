    "This is a walkthrough taking readers through how to build starter Q&A and Chatbot applications using the ChatGPT API and their own data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is laid out in these sections:\n",
    "- **Setup:** \n",
    "    - Initiate variables and source the data\n",
    "- **Lay the foundations:**\n",
    "    - Set up the vector database to accept vectors and data\n",
    "    - Load the dataset, chunk the data up for embedding and store in the vector database\n",
    "- **Make it a product:**\n",
    "    - Add a retrieval step where users provide queries and we return the most relevant entries\n",
    "    - Summarise search results with GPT-3\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Q&A app in Streamlit\n",
    "- **Build your moat:**\n",
    "    - Create an Assistant class to manage context and interact with our bot\n",
    "    - Use the Chatbot to answer questions using semantic search context\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Chatbot app in Streamlit\n",
    "    \n",
    "Upon completion, you have the building blocks to create your own production chatbot or Q&A application using OpenAI APIs and a vector database.\n",

The President of the FIA, in its capacity as prosecuting authority, will ask, in respect of every   disciplinary procedure:        -     -     for the imposition of a suspension upon Competitor’s Staff Certificate of Registration holders   who have contravened the FIA Code of Good Standing or the withdrawal of the Competitor’s   Staff Certificate of Registration (any withdrawal can only be imposed for the remaining period   of the current season of the FIA Formula One World Championship)  and      that these same people not be fined.        The person and/or Competitor sanctioned may bring an appeal before the ICA against the IT’s   decision.        *********        The FIA will inform the relevant Competitor of any proceedings instigated against any member of its   staff. It is the responsibility to the relevant Competitor to send the IT a written request to be heard, and   if granted, it shall be permitted to submit written observations. The FIA undertakes to support before   the IT and/or the ICA any request from the Competitor to intervene as a third party within the   framework of a disciplinary procedure.
